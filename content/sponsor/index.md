You can sponsor MapStruct using [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/mapstruct) or through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mapstruct).
Sponsoring MapStruct does not give influence in how we manage and run the project.
MapStruct will keep being developed by volunteers in their free time.
Sponsoring MapStruct does not offer you any preferential treatment.
New features / bug reports will still be done in the same way as before.
