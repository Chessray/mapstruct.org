It is my pleasure to announce the 1.5.5.Final bug fix release of MapStruct.
This release includes support for Jakarta XML Binding , 1 bug fixes and a documentation improvements.

<!--more-->

### Jakarta XML Binding

In the 1.5 releases we added support for the Jakarta namespace.
With this release we are enhancing the support by supporting Jakarta XML Binding.
This should make it easier for people that want to use MapStruct with Jakarta EE 10.
