      MapStruct follows the _Fork & Pull_ development approach. To get started just fork the [MapStruct repository](http://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct) to your GitHub account and create a new topic branch for each change. Once you are done with your change, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the MapStruct repo.

      ### Updating mapstruct.org

      This web site (mapstruct.org) is created using the fantastic [awestruct](http://awestruct.org/) tool. To update this site, fork the [mapstruct.org repo](http://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct.org) and create a pull request. The individual pages are written in [Haml](http://haml.info/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Building the site using awestruct requires Ruby to be installed on your system.
